# Java_array
The projects demonstrate various Array operations 


Counting distict items in an array you need two loops.

First loop is to iterate through the array 

Second loop is to compare the items with the lest first part

Ie the loops should divide the array into parts

1.Part one is the  array that has been evaluated.
2.Part 2 which is second loop should be the part where you compare item ata index x with the part one

Note in For loops this items are important to master them

For(initialize; condation that must return boolean yes or no ;increament)
